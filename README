DISP -- Independent Information System in Python

This project is my Bachelor Thesis I did in 2006, 

the thesis text and program comments are, unfortunately, in Czech, 

I may translate it and update to recent version of Python someday...

The english abstract follows:

This work tries to close a gap between development of information systems as 
desktop or as web applications and to create a framework for development of 
‘independent information systems’. It consists of a design and its 
implementation in a Python library, which allows development of programs
independent of the form of user interface. It defines a programming interface
 for ‘independent user iterface’ and implements it using three distinct 
‘front-ends’ – Web-, GTK- and XUL- front-ends.
